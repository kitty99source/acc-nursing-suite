  echo   ============================================================
  echo.
  echo   Windows let you run this straight out of the downloaded .zip
  echo   without extracting it first ^(Explorer's zip-preview view^).
  echo   That breaks this launcher: it needs its helper files sitting
  echo   right next to it as real files, which the zip preview does
  echo   not provide.
  echo.
  echo   Fix:
  echo     1. Close this window.
  echo     2. In File Explorer, right-click the downloaded .zip file
  echo        and choose "Extract All..." to a real folder ^(Desktop
  echo        or Documents work well^).
  echo     3. Open the EXTRACTED folder ^(NOT the zip^) and re-run this
  echo        file from there.
